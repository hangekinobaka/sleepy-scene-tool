# Sleepy Scene Tool (for Unity)

Author: He Yiran (SleepyCat)         
Version: 1.2.3      

## Description
In many **Unity** projects, there is a designated entrance scene from which
the project must be started each time.   
However, developers often need to switch to and edit other scenes,
making the process of scene switching tedious and cumbersome.    

Sleepy Scene Tool simplifies the scene transition workflow,
making it easier to focus on the development and editing process.
The system aims to streamline this workflow with the following
features:     

- **Automated Scene Listing:**    
Automatically fetches all scenes and provides a convenient list
for selecting the entrance scene.
You can also use out filter to list only the scenes in the build
settings or include the others.

- **Easy Scene Access:**    
Directly open or additively open scenes from the list for
editing, saving you the hassle of manual searching.

- **Quick Play from Entrance Scene:**    
A menu option to quickly launch the project from the entrance
scene, no matter which scene(s) you are currently editing.

- **Seamless Stop and Resume:**    
Another menu option to stop the running project and swiftly
resume editing the previously open scene(s).
